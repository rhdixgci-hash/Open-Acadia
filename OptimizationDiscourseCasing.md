In modern front-end projects, interactive tables are more than just UI elements—they are knowledge artifacts representing organizational operations and decision-making flows. Optimizing these tables is crucial to improving workflow efficiency, reducing errors, and supporting clear management decisions.

This case study examines the optimization of tariff and scheduling tables in a real-world project, covering create, edit, and list pages with editable rows and columns.

Project Objectives

Analyze the existing table structure and data flow for tariffs and scheduling.

Identify repetitive patterns and inefficiencies to optimize structure.

Define the scope of changes to focus on practical improvements rather than fundamental redesigns.

Improve user experience and reduce potential errors when adding or editing records.

Scope of Optimization

Operational Level: Apply to the create, edit, and list pages of tariff tables.

Change Limitations: Structural optimization and workflow simplification; no introduction of new libraries (e.g., Immer).

Bug Handling: Address critical errors that affect functionality, especially during the add/edit processes.

Exclusions: Large-scale redesigns or architectural overhauls.

Project Management Approach

Current-State Analysis: Study the existing pages, editing capabilities, and table behavior.

Pattern Identification: Look for opportunities to reduce repetition and simplify workflows.

Change Planning: Prioritize minor but high-impact improvements with minimal risk.

Documentation & Reporting: Log daily progress, issues, and proposed optimizations for review and decision-making.

Management-Level Recommendations

Optimize Workflow: Streamline table operations without disrupting existing functionality.

Clarify Roles and Responsibilities: Each table section should have defined behavior for clear management oversight.

Minimal Structural Changes: Focus on improving efficiency and user accuracy, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

Error Management: Prioritize bug fixes according to impact on user experience.

Decision Documentation: Record all changes with rationale, constraints, and expected outcomes.

Key Takeaways

Optimizing tariff and scheduling tables is not merely a technical task—it is a project management challenge. By clarifying scope, defining workflows, and documenting decisions:

Teams can maintain operational stability while improving efficiency.

User experience is protected, ensuring minimal errors during data entry and editing.

Management can track impact, risk, and improvement systematically.

Conclusion

Interactive tables represent both organizational knowledge and operational workflows. Effective optimization requires balancing efficiency, error reduction, and clear management structures, rather than focusing solely on technical performance. Strategic improvements, precise scope definition, and structured reporting ensure projects maintain high-quality outcomes without unnecessary complexity.
